## JsAudio is to Node / JS as PyAudio is to Python

### Goals

The goal of the JsAudio project is to provide a javascript implementation of PortAudio that matches the original API as closely as possible.

### Status

This is a work in progress.

The API is not finalized and as such docs are not in place yet. That being said
you can take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/JsAudioOrg/jsaudio/tree/master/examples) directory to see usage at it's current state.

Currently PortAudio's read/write method is implemented, but the callback method is not.
